    1. {{Pictures Volume1}} / <dates> / {{Category1}} / Category12/ ... / {{name # last folder}} / {{ some pictures }}
    2. {{Pictures Volume2}} / <dates> / {{Category1}} / Category12/ ... / {{name # last folder}} / {{ some pictures }}
    ...
    [n] {{ Pictures Volume [n] }} / <dates> / {{ Category1 [a] }} / {{ Category [a] [b] ...}} /... {{ some pictures }}
